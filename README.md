# Industry-4.0-Evaluation-of-future-applications-and-business-changes
The main purpose of this project is to develop a base for strategy for cameras produced by Allied Vision Technologies in Industry 4.0 framework. The work mainly focuses on the futuristic applications of cameras, which act as sensors and are the focal point on data collection. The objectives are accomplished by analyzing the cameras specificity in technical, and as well as business aspects. In addition to a fundamental analysis of camera parameters and current applications, research analysis on Industry 4.0, and competitor products were the bases to develop scenarios for cameras. The focused scenarios within smart factories were Augmented Reality and Intra Logistics.
